# Questions ðŸ¤”

- List all data types. List all embedded collections and a couple of their prototype methods each.
- What are explicit and implicit type coercions? Give at least one example of the former and the latter.
- If we want to disallow `Object` to primitive type conversion, which prototype methods do we need to override?
- The difference between `var` vs. `let` vs. `const`.
- `WeakMap` vs. `Map` and `WeakSet` vs. `Set`.
- `Array.prototype.forEach` vs. `for (;;)`. Which of these is more flexible?
- Is multiple inheritance possible in JavaScript and why?
- What is prototype contamination?
- Why is the `new` operator needed? How does it work? When does it not work?
- What is a polyfill? And why might it be needed?
- What is immutability? What are some native ways to make data in JavaScript immutable?
- `shift`, `unshift`, `push`, `pop`. Divide into two parts: fastest and slowest procedures. And why?
